NeuOsc: Python Package for Neutrino Oscillations
================================================

Documentation is available in the docstrings and
online at https://neuosc.neutrino.xyz.

Contents
--------

This module is till WIP. The plan is to cover several subpackages:

::

  constants                      --- Constants Related to Neutrinos
  vacuum                         --- Vacuum Oscillations
  matter                         --- Oscillations in Matter
  lite                           --- Lite Version of This Package

To use NeuOsc subpackages, simply import the correspoding subpackage,
e.g., ``import neuosc.constants``.
